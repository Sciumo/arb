This directory is a good place for sockets used by unit-tests.

Note: OSX socket names are limited to 104 characters
      => do not define too long socket names
      ("dbserver.socket" is already near the limit)


List of currently used sockets:

        dbserver.socket
        pt.socket
        ptgene.socket
        test.socket
